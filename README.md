# E-Commerce Database Backend

## Description
This project was made to learn how to use sequelize in conjunction with express to make calls to a sql database using a live server. During development, I learned the importance of consistency and syntax when integrating multiple dependencies.

## Installation
Clone the Git repo to your local machine, run npm i in the root folder. Log in to mysql and use the "source db/schema.sql" command, followed by the "exit" command.

## Usage
Run the command "npm run seed" to seed the database with data. Start the program with "npm start" from the command line then open insomnia or similar program to try get/post/put/delete routes.
